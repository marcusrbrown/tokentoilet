## Overview

Token Toilet is a modern DeFi application that helps crypto enthusiasts clean up their digital wallets while contributing to charitable causes. It provides a fun, interactive way to dispose of unwanted tokens while potentially helping others.

### Key Features

- ðŸš½ **Token Disposal**: Safely dispose of any ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens
- ðŸŽ² **Random Token Fountain**: Receive random tokens for your charitable contributions
- ðŸ’§ **Charity Integration**: All proceeds are automatically donated to verified charitable causes
- ðŸ§¾ **On-chain Proof of Disposal**: Get NFT receipts for your contributions

## Why Token Toilet?

In the evolving Web3 landscape, wallets often accumulate:

- Abandoned governance tokens from defunct DAOs
- Airdropped tokens with no clear utility
- NFTs from discontinued projects
- Tokens from failed or compromised protocols

Instead of letting these tokens gather dust or sending them to a burn address, Token Toilet creates value by:

1. Providing a verifiable disposal mechanism
2. Converting "waste" into charitable contributions
3. Creating a fun, gamified experience for the community

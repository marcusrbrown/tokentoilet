# Token Toilet

> A Web3 DeFi application for disposing of unwanted tokens while supporting charitable causes. Built with Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript + Wagmi v2 + Reown AppKit, featuring a complete design system with violet branding and glass morphism aesthetics.

Token Toilet provides a fun, gamified way to dispose of unwanted tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721) while contributing to charity through a "token fountain" mechanism. The project combines token disposal with charitable giving, creating an entertaining way to clean up crypto wallets while generating value for good causes.

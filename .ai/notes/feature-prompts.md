# Feature Prompts

This document collects prompts that can be used with AI assistants to generate implementation plans using the [/create-implementation-plan](https://github.com/PlagueHO/awesome-copilot/blob/9fe63b3aed16abc391fe7d2b957e0d4bf3517ce8/prompts/create-implementation-plan.prompt.md) prompt in Copilot Chat.

## ðŸš½ Core Token Disposal Interface

```markdown
Create the main token disposal interface for Token Toilet. Build a React component that allows users to select and dispose of ERC-20 tokens from their wallet. Use the existing useWallet hook and design tokens system (violetPalette, glassMorphism) for consistent styling. Include token balance display, disposal amount selection, and transaction status feedback. Follow the Web3 error handling patterns and use semantic colors from the design system for transaction states.
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Gamified Token Fountain Component

```markdown
Implement the "Random Token Fountain" feature using the established design patterns. Create an animated component that shows users receiving random tokens after disposal, leveraging the glassMorphism and web3Animations from the design tokens. Integrate with the Web3Provider chain and include proper loading states, transaction confirmations, and NFT receipt generation. Use the violet gradient system and ensure dark mode compatibility.
```

## ðŸ”— Smart Contract Integration Layer

```markdown
Set up the smart contract development environment and create the TokenToilet contract integration. Follow the Wagmi v2 patterns for contract interactions, implement the disposal and fountain mechanisms, and create typed contract hooks. Include multi-chain support (mainnet/sepolia) using the existing chain configuration. Add comprehensive error handling following the project's "no throw on disconnect" pattern and integrate with the TanStack Query setup.
```

### Smart Contract Integration

```markdown
Implement the TokenToilet contract interaction layer following the established Wagmi patterns. Create custom hooks for token disposal operations in `/hooks/use-token-disposal.ts`, add contract configuration to config.ts, and build UI components in web3 that handle token approval flows, batch operations, and transaction status tracking. Follow the existing error handling patterns and maintain consistency with the current wallet integration.
```

## Token Discovery & Management System

```markdown
Build a comprehensive token discovery system that leverages the existing Web3 architecture. Create `/components/web3/token-browser.tsx` for displaying user tokens, `/hooks/use-token-balance.ts` for fetching balances, and `/lib/web3/token-utils.ts` for token metadata handling. Implement the violet/gradient design system and ensure proper loading states, error boundaries, and wallet connection dependencies match the current patterns.
```

## Charitable Integration & NFT Receipts

```markdown
Develop the charity integration system with NFT proof-of-disposal functionality. Create `/components/web3/charity-selector.tsx`, `/hooks/use-charity-donation.ts`, and NFT minting components that follow the established Wagmi patterns. Integrate with the existing Web3Provider setup, maintain the glass morphism UI design, and implement proper transaction tracking that builds on the current wallet button and error handling conventions.
```

## Advanced Web3 Transaction Management System

"Implement a comprehensive transaction history and management system that leverages the existing `useWallet` hook architecture. Create components for tracking token disposal transactions across all supported chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum), with real-time status updates using Wagmi's transaction watching capabilities. Include transaction receipts, failure recovery mechanisms, and a unified transaction list component that follows the established glass morphism design patterns using the CSS custom properties already defined in globals.css. Ensure full test coverage following the established wallet-specific testing patterns in `/hooks/use-wallet.*.test.ts`."

## Multi-Chain Token Discovery and Validation Engine

"Build an intelligent token discovery system that integrates with the existing multi-chain Web3 configuration to automatically detect and validate tokens across Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum networks. Implement token metadata fetching, balance checking, and spam token filtering using the established error handling patterns from `useWallet`. Create a token selection interface using the violet-branded design system with real-time network switching capabilities. Include comprehensive Vitest test suites that mock different token contract scenarios and network states, following the established mocking patterns for Web3 functionality."

## Charitable Impact Visualization Dashboard

"Develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes the charitable impact of token disposal activities, leveraging the existing glass morphism design system and Web3 state management. Create animated components that show real-time charitable contributions, token disposal statistics, and community impact metrics. Implement the dashboard using the established CSS custom properties for consistent theming, Web3 animations from globals.css, and the `useWallet` hook for connecting user activity to impact metrics. Include responsive design patterns that work across all supported wallet types and ensure proper dark/light mode support using the existing theme system."

## Multi-Chain Token Discovery & Metadata Enhancement

"Implement a token discovery system that leverages the existing multi-chain configuration (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum) to automatically detect and categorize user's token holdings across networks. Build on the current `useWallet` hook patterns and Web3 state management to create a unified token inventory component that respects the glass morphism design system. Integrate with the existing Wagmi/TanStack Query architecture to cache token metadata and implement the violet-themed loading states for cross-chain queries. Follow the established testing patterns with comprehensive mocking for different network states and token contract interactions."

## Glass Morphism Transaction Flow Components

"Design and implement a complete transaction flow system using the established glass morphism design tokens (`.glass-container`, `.glass-card`, `.glass-button`) and CSS custom properties for Web3 operations. Create reusable transaction components that integrate with the current `useWallet` error handling patterns and support the three-chain configuration. Build transaction status indicators using the defined Web3 state colors (`--color-web3-pending`, `--color-web3-confirmed`, etc.) while maintaining the Tailwind v4 CSS-first approach with zero `@apply` directives. Include comprehensive Vitest test coverage for transaction state management and error scenarios."

## Charitable Organization Integration Hub

"Develop a charity selection and verification system that extends the current Web3 provider architecture to include nonprofit organization smart contract integration. Build upon the existing Reown AppKit wallet connection flows to enable multi-signature charity wallet verification and donation tracking across the supported blockchain networks. Implement the component following the established patterns with client-side rendering, proper error boundaries, and the violet brand theming. Create a comprehensive testing suite that mocks charity contract interactions and validates cross-chain donation flows using the existing Web3 testing infrastructure and mocking patterns."

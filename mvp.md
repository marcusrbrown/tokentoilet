2. "What's the best approach for ensuring transparent fund tracking?"

#### D. ProofOfDisposal.sol
- NFT minting logic
- Metadata management
- Historical tracking

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "How can we make the NFT receipts more engaging and collectible?"
2. "What's the best way to implement on-chain metadata for disposal proofs?"

## 3. Integration Points

### B. Token Workflows
- Approval management
- Balance verification
- Transaction building

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "How can we optimize the approval process for better UX?"
2. "What's the best way to handle failed approvals and transactions?"

### C. Charity Integration
- Organization onboarding
- Payment processing
- Reporting system

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "How should we implement charity verification and vetting?"
2. "What's the best approach for automated reporting and transparency?"

## 4. Technical Considerations

### A. Security
- Smart contract auditing
- Frontend security
- Transaction safety

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "What additional security measures should we implement beyond standard auditing?"
2. "How can we implement emergency pause mechanisms effectively?"

### B. Scalability
- L2 integration
- Gas optimization
- Performance monitoring

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "How should we handle cross-chain token disposal?"
2. "What's the best approach for optimizing gas costs across different L2s?"

### C. User Experience
- Mobile responsiveness
- Error handling
- Performance optimization

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "How can we make the disposal process more engaging?"
2. "What metrics should we track to optimize user experience?"

## 5. Launch Strategy

### A. Testing Phase
- Testnet deployment
- Community testing
- Security audits

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "What's the optimal testnet strategy across multiple networks?"
2. "How should we structure the community testing program?"

### B. Mainnet Launch
- Deployment sequence
- Marketing strategy
- Community engagement

**Follow-up Prompts:**
1. "What's the best approach for a phased mainnet rollout?"
